# ARDUINO-RAINWATER-ALARM
Project Description:



Rain Alarm Project is a simple but very useful project that detects Rain(Rain
Water) and automatically triggers an alarm or buzzer.

Here, a low-cost, large coverage and user friendly water quality monitoring system with multi-sensor which is based on
Wi-Fi Technology is presented. The process of designing the system involves
three main parts which are hardware development, software development and
also wireless network process.

For the hardware development part, different
types of the sensor will be employed and the sensors will be integrated with
a microcontroller. As for the software development, a few programming
software is integrated for data acquisition, processing and displaying. Finally,
for the wireless network process, the wireless network module is used for data
transmitting and receiving while the website is used to display the obtained
data.
